## This pair of functions (i.e., makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve) 
## can cache the inverse of a matrix because Matrix inversion is
## usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to
## caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object 
## that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL # cache (set matrix to NULL
        set <- function(y) { # Passing a square matrix 
                x <<- y # Matrix assigned to a variable (x) in 
                # makeCacheMatrix 
                s <<- NULL # if set() get new matrix, clear previous 
                # cache 
        }
        get <- function() x # get() subfunction returns matrix stored 
        # in x
        setinv <- function(solve) s <<- solve # inverse matrix is 
        # passed to (solve) and stored in the parent environment
        getinv <- function() s # Returns cache
        list(set = set, get = get, # list of all subfunctions
             setinv = setinv,
             getinv = getinv)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already 
## been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        # Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        s2 <- x$getinv() # call makeCacheMatrix using getinv() 
        # subfunction, which returns the cache "s" and stores it 
        # in a new variable "s2".
        
        if(!is.null(s2)) { # checks if the returned cache is empty
                # (!is.null(s2).
                return(s2) # and the content of cache is returned.
        }
        matrix <- x$get() # else Matrix passed with get()
        inv_matrix <- solve(matrix, ...) # Inverse using the solve()
        # function.
        x$setinv(inv_matrix) # Pass inverse matrix to setinv() which
        # stores it to "s" (cache).
        inv_matrix # Inverse matrix Returned.
